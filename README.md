## How It's Made/Works:
**Built with: React and Vite**

This multi-step form is a front-end only project that I used as a way to practice building my first React app. I wanted to get a feel for "thinking in
React", creating/using components and using props and state. This application walks you through a form, which collects user info from text
inputs and user preferences from checkbox and radio buttons. All of this information is kept track of in state and is used at the end of the form to 
display a monetary total to the user, based on their selected preferences. This total changes depending on their selections, can be edited and the form
can be submitted at the end (there is no backend so the user info currently console logged on submission).

This application is highly interactive and fully responsive. The purpose of this project is to implement components and to build an interactive and good
looking UI.

## Lessons Learned:

This project taught me how to:
- create and use React components
- pass props to components
- utilize conditional rendering with JSX
- create and use state
- keep track of user inputs

I have a much firmer grasp of React after completing this project. I think the most important takeaway for me is having a deeper understanding of WHY
React is such a great tool to build UI and to improve the user experience. I found React extremely confusing at first and thought it was a lot of extra
work to implement. I now see the value of it and am looking forward to creating more projects with this awesome library.
